				<summary>An Optimal and Flexible TCAM Software Simulation Algorithm</summary>
				<pre style="text-align:left;font-size: 110%;">This paper presents an optimal and flexible algorithm for matching many 
search keys against many entries with arbitrary wildcard (i.e., "don't care") 
bits to simulate TCAM lookups in software. The algorithm is also enhanced by 
using more memory to match search keys containing arbitrary wildcards. 
To speed up the lookup operation in the functional TCAM model, the algorithm 
stores intermediary results in a two-dimensional array based on the TCAM entries.
It is proved that the algorithm uses the optimal number of bit wise-AND operations 
in finding the matches. In a theoretical analysis, the proposed algorithm achieves 
a speedup factor of more than 16 compared to sequential search using reasonable memory 
footprints, and the best speedup reaches a factor of 27 in our experiments. Finally, 
the empirical evaluation of the algorithm identifies a sweet spot in the trade-off between 
space and time which can be practically configurable in simulation.</pre>
