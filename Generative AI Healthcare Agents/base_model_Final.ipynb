The plan is appropriate in this case as it addresses both potential complications from ascites accumulation such as hyponatremia or hypokalemia due to sodium loss through diarrheal losses . It also accounts for other possible sequelae including hepatorenal syndrome which can lead to further volume depletion  by recommending close attention be paid towards evidence of worsening renal function via urine output measurements , creatinine levels [10–23], electrolyte panels [9, 45] and blood pressure checks that may indicate need for intravenous fluids administration if necessary.

However, it should be noted that some ACE inhibitors may cause coughing due to angiotensins II receptor blockage which can lead to bronchospasm; therefore caution must be taken when administered these types of medicines especially if there has previously existed respiratory conditions like asthma [2–5].

Therefore further testing for these conditions would need to be considered before starting therapy. It will help you decide whether antimicrobials have any role here at all or not.
