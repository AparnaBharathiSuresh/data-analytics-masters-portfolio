💼 Key Projects

🧬 [Generative AI Healthcare Agents]

Designed and fine-tuned LLM-powered chatbots for wellness applications using NLP and deep learning.

Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure accurate, explainable healthcare responses.

Collaborated across disciplines to bridge technical innovation with real-world medical needs.

🧏‍♀️ [Sign Language Interpretation System](./DeepLearning/Project_SignLanguage)

Developed a system that interprets sign language data using generative AI and LLMs.

Utilized transformer-based models to map sign inputs into natural language sentences.

Improved translation accuracy and contextual understanding through iterative feedback.

🔍 [Text-to-SQL LLM Application](./GenAI/Project_TextToSQL)

Built a natural language interface to generate SQL using a fine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model on the SPIDER dataset.

Integrated agentic reasoning to handle ambiguous queries and clarify user intent before SQL generation.

🧠 [AI-Powered Patent Analysis System](./BigDataAnalytics/Project)

Created an NLP-based system using PyTorch and the OpenAI API to analyze large-scale patent data.

Built interactive dashboards for insight extraction and product innovation strategy.

📰 [New York Times Sentiment Prediction](./DataBaseSystems/NewYorkTimes_Analysis)

Built a sentiment analysis model to classify article tone using livestream data from the NYT.

Developed a full pipeline using AWS, Apache Airflow, dbt, and Snowflake as the central data warehouse.

🌐 [Inventors Circle](./DistribuedSystems/Project-InventorsCircle)

Designed and deployed a MERN-based collaboration platform to connect inventors and researchers.

Implemented hybrid recommendation systems and hosted on AWS EC2 for scalable access.

📊 [Life Expectancy Analysis](./MachineLearning/Project_LifeExpectancy)

Analyzed global health trends using Tableau dashboards and regression models.

Identified key predictors of life expectancy across 193 countries from 2000 to 2015.
